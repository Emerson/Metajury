h1. Welcome to Rocket Fuel

Rocket Fuel is a simple application bootstrap that helps you avoid coding repetitive tasks. In an attempt to avoid too much magic, Rocket Fuel development avoids the use of gems, opting for simple and clean in-application logic. At the moment, Rocket Fuel uses <strong>Twitter Bootstrap 2.0</strong> for the presentation layer. This seems like the best option, as it provides sensible, minimal markup, while allowing for easy customization by future developers.
